        <p class="g-font-size-28--xs g-font-size-24--md g-margin-b-0--xs g-color--white-opacity">Miss Punjab is a yearly competition organized by the company, THE MANAGERS NETWORK. This mainly
            aims at providing a stage to the young, talented females of Punjab to showcase their fashion skills and
            have an experience like never before. CoLinkers along with the Virsa team (Virsa is the annual fest of
            Thapar University celebrating the Punjabi culture) organized the Patiala auditions for the same. Big
            personalities were present to judge the show.
            Following up the amazing auditions, the MANAGERS NETWORK decided to conduct the semi finals as
            well as the Grand Finale of MISS PUNJAB,2017 in Patiala only!! There was no doubt in the minds of the

            organizers in handling over this responsibility to CoLinkers and Virsa. We both had the motive of making
            the event a huge success and so it was.</p>
