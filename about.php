            <p class="g-font-size-22--xs g-font-size-24--md g-margin-b-0--xs g-color--white-opacity">CoLinkers is an event management company that focuses on providing sponsorship, Publicity and market value to events at various levels. Founded in February 2017 by young and energetic entrepreneurs of Thapar University, Patiala is now registered as Private Limited Company, which is the highest form of company ownership in India. CoLinkers is growing rapidly as it maintains its distinction as a company that links events to its sponsors, venues, and people. CoLinkers was conceived by Tushar Dey, Ansh Arora and his friends when they realized that there was an enormous potential in this highly-fragmented market with no players. Therefore, he started tying up the loose ends together to start CoLinkers India&rsquo;s first &amp; largest online events management company which serves to various types of events.</p>
